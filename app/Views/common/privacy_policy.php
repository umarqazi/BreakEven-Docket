                            We may use “cookies” or other tools to collect certain information from all users, including Web visitors who don’t buy anything through our Website. A cookie is a string of data our system sends to your computer and then uses to identify your computer when you return to our Website or use BreakEven DOCKET products or services. Cookies give us usage data, like how often you visit, where you go at the site, and what you do.

                            We do not knowingly collect PII through our Website or BreakEven DOCKET products or services from children under the age of 13. The Website and BreakEven DOCKET products and services are intended for and directed to adults.

                        <p>
                            Personally Identifiable Information may be used to create your account, to communicate with you about products and services you’ve purchased, to offer you additional products and services, as part of your use of the products and services, and to bill you. We may also use that information to the extent necessary to enforce our Website and BreakEven DOCKET Terms of Service and to prevent imminent harm to persons or property. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We may use cookies or other tools so that our Website, products and services can remember you and provide you with the information you’re most likely to need. For instance, when you return to our Website, cookies identify you and prompt the site to provide your username (not your password), so you can sign in more quickly. Cookies also allow our Website to remind you of your past purchases and to suggest similar products and services. Finally, we use information gained through cookies to compile statistical information about use of our Website, products and services such as the time users spend at the site and the pages they visit most often. Those statistics do not include PII.

                        <p>
                            We employ physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect Personally Identifiable Information. Unfortunately, even with these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using our Website, products and services, you acknowledge and agree that we make no such guarantee, and that you use our Website, products and services at your own risk.

                            We may give certain independent contractors and service providers access to Personally Identifiable Information. Those contractors assist us with maintaining and updating the website and BreakEven DOCEKT products and services and providing additional services to BreakEven DOCKET users. All those contractors are required to sign contracts in which they promise to protect PII using procedures reasonably similar to ours. (Users are not third party beneficiaries of those contracts.) We also may disclose PII to attorneys, collection agencies, or law enforcement authorities to address potential AUP violations, other contract violations, or illegal behavior. And we disclose any information demanded in a court order or otherwise required by law or to prevent imminent harm to persons or property. Finally, we may share PII in connection with a corporate transaction, like a merger or sale of our company, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or of the product or service line you received from us, or a bankruptcy.

                            As noted above, we compile Website and product and service usage statistics from data collected through cookies. We may publish those statistics or share them with third parties, but they don’t include PII.
